<span class="i0"><em>In a land that the sand overlays&mdash;the ways to her gates are untrod&mdash;</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>A multitude ended their days whose fates were made splendid by God,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>Till they grew drunk and were smitten with madness and went to their fall,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>And of these is a story written: but Allah alone knoweth all!</em><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When the wine stirred in their heart their bosoms dilated,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They rose to suppose themselves kings over all things created&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To decree a new earth at a birth without labour or sorrow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To declare: 'We prepare it to-day and inherit to-morrow.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They chose themselves prophets and priests of minute understanding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men swift to see done, and outrun, their extremest commanding&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the tribe which describe with a jibe the perversions of Justice&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panders avowed to the crowd whatsoever its lust is.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Swiftly these pulled down the walls that their fathers had made them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The impregnable ramparts of old, they razed and relaid them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As playgrounds of pleasure and leisure with limitless entries,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And havens of rest for the wastrels where once walked the sentries;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because there was need of more pay for the shouters and marchers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They disbanded in face of their foemen their bowmen and archers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They replied to their well-wishers' fears&mdash;to their enemies' laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saying: 'Peace! We have fashioned a God Which shall save us hereafter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We ascribe all dominion to man in his factions conferring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have given to numbers the Name of the Wisdom unerring.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said: 'Who has hate in his soul? Who has envied his neighbour?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him arise and control both that man and his labour.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said: 'Who is eaten by sloth? Whose unthrift has destroyed him?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He shall levy a tribute from all because none have employed him.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said: 'Who hath toiled? Who hath striven, and gathered possession?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him be spoiled. He hath given full proof of transgression.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They said. 'Who is irked by the Law? <em>Though we may not remove it,</em><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><em>If he lend us his aid in this raid, we will set him above it!</em>'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the robber did judgment again upon such as displeased him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slayer, too, boasted his slain, and the judges released him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As for their kinsmen far off, on the skirts of the nation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They harried all earth to make sure none escaped reprobation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They awakened unrest for a jest in their newly-won borders,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And jeered at the blood of their brethren betrayed by their orders.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They instructed the ruled to rebel, their rulers to aid them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, since such as obeyed them not fell, their Viceroys obeyed them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the riotous set them at naught they said: 'Praise the upheaval!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the show and the word and the thought of Dominion is evil!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They unwound and flung from them with rage, as a rag that defiled them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imperial gains of the age which their forefathers piled them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ran panting in haste to lay waste and embitter for ever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wellsprings of Wisdom and Strength which are Faith and Endeavour.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They nosed out and digged up and dragged forth and exposed to derision<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All doctrine of purpose and worth and restraint and prevision:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it ceased, and God granted them all things for which they had striven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of a beast in the place of a man's heart was given&hellip;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class='in' /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When they were fullest of wine and most flagrant in error,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the sea rose a sign&mdash;out of Heaven a terror.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they saw, then they heard, then they knew&mdash;for none troubled to hide it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An host had prepared their destruction, but still they denied it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They denied what they dared not abide if it came to the trial,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But the Sword that was forged while they lied did not heed their denial.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It drove home, and no time was allowed to the crowd that was driven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The preposterous-minded were cowed&mdash;they thought time would be given.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no need of a steed nor a lance to pursue them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was decreed their own deed, and not chance, should undo them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tares they had laughingly sown were ripe to the reaping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trust they had leagued to disown was removed from their keeping.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eaters of other men's bread, the exempted from hardship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The excusers of impotence fled, abdicating their wardship.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hate they had taught through the State brought the State no defender,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And it passed from the roll of the Nations in headlong surrender.<br /></span>
